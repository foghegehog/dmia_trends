# Data Mining in Action, Trends direction, Spring 2018
This repo contains completed homeworks from the [DMiA](http://dmia.space/) "Trends" course, Spring 2018, that seemed to me worthwhile and convenient to upload: <br><ul>
<li><b>DogsCats.ipynb</b> - a model on the PyTorch framework that distinguishing images with dogs from images with cats.</li>
<li><b>Capsules.ipynb</b> - funetuning of the Capsules Networks on the CIFAR10 dataset</li>
</ul>
